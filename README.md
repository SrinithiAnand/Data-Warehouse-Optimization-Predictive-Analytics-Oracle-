# Data Warehouse Optimization & Predictive Analytics (Oracle)

## ✅ Overview
This project combines data warehousing, SQL performance optimization and machine learning using Oracle.  
It includes index tuning, materialized views, EXPLAIN PLAN analysis, and classification models for credit risk prediction.

## ✅ Part 1: Data Warehouse Optimization
- Designed analytical SQL queries involving SALES, CUSTOMERS, PRODUCTS, CHANNELS and PROMOTIONS
- Created custom B-tree indexes to improve selectivity
- Measured performance improvement using EXPLAIN PLAN
- Designed & implemented materialized views with multiple aggregate functions
- Verified query rewrite via optimizer and compared performance (100× faster)

## ✅ Part 2: Predictive Analytics
- Loaded and split credit card dataset (train/test) using SQL & DBMS_RANDOM
- Built Random Forest and SVM classification models using Oracle Data Mining API
- Evaluated model performance:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix

## ✅ Technologies
Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, Materialized Views, Oracle Data Mining API, Random Forest, SVM

## ✅ Key Results
- MV reduced query execution cost from 3750 → 7
- Random Forest achieved higher precision and lower false positives than SVM
- Complete performance evaluation and business recommendations provided
